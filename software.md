Since 2016, I put all my code into github: [link](https://github.com/HAIRLAB).

You need [CVX](http://cvxr.com/cvx/) to run the following code examples:

1. Matlab code for Y. Yuan, M. Li and C. J. Tomlin, On the Powerball method. [download](https://github.com/HAIRLAB)

2. Matlab code for W.Pan, Y. Yuan*, J. Goncalves and G.-B. Stan, A Sparse Bayesian Approach to the Identification of Nonlinear State-Space Systems. [Download](https://github.com/panweihit/BSID)
