Since 2016, I put all my code into github: [download](https://github.com/HAIRLAB/CPSid)

You need [CVX](http://cvxr.com/cvx/) to run the following code examples:

1. Matlab code for Y. Yuan, M. Li and C. J. Tomlin, On the Powerball method. [download](http://hybrid.eecs.berkeley.edu/~yeyuan/pb.zip)

2. Matlab code for Y. Yuan, Y. Nakahira and C. Tomlin, On identification of parameterized switched linear systems. [download](http://hybrid.eecs.berkeley.edu/~yeyuan/id0.zip)

3. Matlab code for W.Pan, Y. Yuan*, J. Goncalves and G.-B. Stan, A Sparse Bayesian Approach to the Identification of Nonlinear State-Space Systems. [Download](http://hybrid.eecs.berkeley.edu/~yeyuan/id1.zip)
