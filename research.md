#### Current Research Interests: 

On the unification of System Identification, Control, Optimization and Machine Learning with applications to the understanding and (re-)design of natural and man-made systems. In particular, I have been focusing on applications such as manufacturing, robotics, biology and power systems. 


#### Testbed in my lab:

Quadrotors (Vicon Motion Capture System, Crazyflie 2.0)

Robots (UR3, Kinect)

Hypersim 

GPU cluster (Nvidia 1080)
